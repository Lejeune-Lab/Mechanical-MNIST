### Mechanical-MNIST
Mechanical-MNIST is a benchmark dataset for mechanical meta-models

The Mechanical MNIST dataset contains the results of 70,000 (60,000 training examples + 10,000 test examples) finite element simulation of a heterogeneous material subject to large deformation. Mechanical MNIST is generated by first converting the MNIST bitmap images (http://www.pymvpa.org/datadb/mnist.html) to 2D heterogeneous blocks of a Neo-Hookean material. Consistent with the MNIST bitmap (28 x 28 pixels), the material domain is a 28 x 28 unit square. The bottom of the domain is fixed (Dirichlet boundary condition), the left and right edges of the domain are free, and the top of the domain is moved to a set of given fixed displacements. The results of the simulations include: (1) change in strain energy at each step, (2) total reaction force at the top boundary at each step, and (3) full field displacement at each step. All simulations are conducted with the FEniCS computing platform (https://fenicsproject.org).
